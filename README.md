### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a third-year Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering student with a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. I am focused on researching and developing high-performance AI solutions, particularly in:
- 🧠 Optimizing Deep Learning models (through techniques like quantization and pruning) to achieve maximum performance.
- 💡 Deploying AI algorithms on embedded devices (Edge AI / AI on Edge).
- 🚗 My long-term goal is to conduct in-depth research in AI for Self-Driving Cars and to pursue a Master's degree in South Korea.

### 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On

-   **Primary Focus:** I am currently focusing on optimization techniques for the **YOLO** family of models to improve speed and efficiency on resource-constrained devices.
-   **Hands-on Project:** I am part of a team building a **multi-camera security surveillance system for a bank**. My responsibilities include:
    -   Optimizing the detection model (quantization, pruning).
    -   Designing and optimizing the video processing pipeline.
    -   Developing the business logic for the security application.
    *(Note: Due to the nature of this team project, the source code is hosted in a private repository).*
